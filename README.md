# Multi-PDF Chatbot - ðŸ¤–

## Description

This Streamlit application allows users to upload multiple PDF files and ask questions based on the content of those documents. It utilizes Google's Generative AI models to provide answers by first processing the PDFs, extracting text, chunking it, and creating a vector store for efficient semantic search.

## Features

- **Upload Multiple PDFs:** Users can upload and process several PDF files at once.
- **Ask Questions:** Interact with the combined content of the uploaded PDFs by asking natural language questions.
- **AI-Powered Answers:** Leverages Google's Generative AI to understand the context of your questions and provide relevant answers based on the PDF content.
- **Streamlit Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- **Progress Indication:** Shows a "Processing..." spinner during the PDF processing stage.
- **Success Confirmation:** Displays a "Done" message upon successful processing of the PDF files.
